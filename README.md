> [!NOTE]
> This project is a comprehensive Java-based application designed to manage train routes, stations and ticket prices, providing users with the ability to search for routes between various cities. Key components of the project include: JavaFX, Gradle, PostgreSQL for database management, the MVC Pattern, data validation and the Observer Pattern.

The user can enter the app by clicking the 'Open New Client Window' button:

From here, clients can look for a certain route by using the 'Select Departure' and 'Select Destination' dropdown menus:

Users can choose whether they wish to see all the possible routes, or the direct ones only, by clicking the checkbox:

Clients can also see how many other users are looking at the same route as themselves:
